# animated

Graphical tool created in Matlab to improve visualisation of aerospace data. The data consists of positions, times and reference orbit of spacecraft flying in formation, performing manoeuvres to re-arrange the formation in different configurations while collision among each other is avoided.

The graphical interface shows an animation of the data given in the Hill frame, providing buttons to modify the visualisation. Also, the reference orbit allows plotting the data in an inertial frame of reference (i.e. the movement of spacecraft in relation to a planet or star).

Done under the supervision of Dr. Matteo Ceriotti from University of Glasgow. Special thanks to Leonel Palacios, also from University of Glasgow.
